This script was initially written by @Disservin, @vondele, and other contributors to [Fishtest](https://github.com/official-stockfish/fishtest).

It is updated by @maximmasiutin (Maxim Masiutin) to skip the first column (rank number) and allow renaming the contributors by including the names in the dictionary (associated array with strings as an index). There are also minor optimizations to exclude string constant duplication.
